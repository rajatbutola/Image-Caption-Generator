## Introduction
This project is designed to generate captions for images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation, the application creates meaningful descriptions of images. It employs models like VGG16 for feature extraction and LSTM for generating sequences of words.

## Features
- Extracts features from images using pre-trained CNN models.
- Generates captions using LSTM models.
- Evaluates model performance with BLEU scores.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and run the project:


Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajatbutola/Image-Caption-Generator.git
cd Image-Caption-Generator
```


## Usage
To use the image caption generator:

## Prepare the Data

Ensure you have a dataset of images and their corresponding captions.
Modify the data preprocessing script if necessary.
Train the Model:

Run the training script to train the model on your dataset.
## Model Training
Data Preprocessing

Extract features from images using a pre-trained CNN model.
Tokenize captions and create sequences of word indices.
## Model Training

Train the model using the preprocessed data.
Save the trained model for generating captions.
## Hyperparameter Tuning

Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance.
## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using BLEU scores.
